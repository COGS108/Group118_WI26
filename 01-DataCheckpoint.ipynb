    "Beyond the physical grit of the sport, hockey is defined by individual \"changemakers\" who shift a team's dynamic toward a Stanley Cup victory. The NHL recognizes this individual excellence through three primary awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (Most Valuable Player), the Vezina Trophy (Best Goaltender), and the James Norris Memorial Trophy (Best Defenseman). Together, these honors encompass the core roles of the game: forwards, goalies, and defenders, each contributing uniquely to a team's success through scoring, shot-blocking, and net-minding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their prestige, these awards are often criticized for their subjective nature. The Vezina is voted on by NHL General Managers, while the Hart and Norris are decided by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. This human element introduces significant bias; for example, analyst JFresh<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)</a> noted a recurring bias against elite players on high-performing teams, where individual value is often overshadowed by the quality of a player’s supporting cast in his blog post 'The Hart Trophy is for the Best Player in the League \"umm actually\" shut up!'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the financial stakes are massive: insider Elliotte Friedman noted on the 32 Thoughts podcast<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)</a> that a franchise star like Connor McDavid (who is a 3 time Hart trophy winner) can generate up to an additional $50 million in team revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to objectify this evaluation process using data-driven modeling to define what truly constitutes \"the best\" at each position. We are building upon—and refining—methodologies seen in prior sports analytics work. For instance, a project exploring the various relationships between players’ birthdays, their experience vs. goal percentage, and age vs. penalty minutes used a variety of charts to identify and display different categorical and numerical data, such as box and scatter plots <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)</a>. They clearly organize their data in an easily accessible and understandable way—a method we can adopt to make our report more clear and simple to look at. For one of their hypotheses, the conclusion they drew for the relationship between goal percentage and shooting rates was that there wasn’t a strong linear correlation since the coefficient was 0.2. We can apply these learnings to our own project by accounting for the fact that there may be other factors that influence the value of a player, including being surrounded by a good team, as mentioned before by JFresh. \n",

    "We hypothesize that a player’s plus-minus will have the most statistically significant weight in determining the Hart and Norris Trophy award winner. This is because it is the most indicative measure of individual importance for team success in a game. A player can score a lot of goals, but if their +- is negative, it likely means that they are contributing to losses more than wins because they are contributing to more points lost than gained. We will use a multivariable regression model to address for team dependency, where we will keep 'teammate_goals' and 'teammate_points' as control variables. This will allow us to determine whether if +- represents individual value or is a simply a product of team success. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe for the Vezina trophy the most statistically significant weight will be the save percentage. We will create a regression model against 'Shots_Against'. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test which combination of statistics predicts the winner most accurately, we will create a Random Forest model to find feature importance. This will allow us to identify the most optimal combinations of variables that contribute to the players winning the award. "

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
