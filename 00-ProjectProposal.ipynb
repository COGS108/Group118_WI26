    "Which combination of player performance statistics can be optimally integrated into a single aggregate metric that most accurately predicts the winners of the NHL regular-season awards (Hart Memorial Trophy, Vezina Trophy, and Norris Trophy)?\n",

    "Specifically, this research seeks to determine how traditional and advanced statistical measures, such as goals, assists, plus/minus, minutes played, and games played, among others, can be weighted and combined to form a composite indicator of player value that best aligns with historical award outcomes."

    "Beyond the physical grit of the sport, hockey is defined by individual \"changemakers\" who shift a team's dynamic toward a Stanley Cup victory. The NHL recognizes this individual excellence through three primary awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (Most Valuable Player), the Vezina Trophy (Best Goaltender), and the James Norris Memorial Trophy (Best Defenseman). Together, these honors encompass the core roles of the game: forwards, goalies, and defenders, each contributing uniquely to a team's success through scoring, shot-blocking, and net-minding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their prestige, these awards are often criticized for their subjective nature. The Vezina is voted on by NHL General Managers, while the Hart and Norris are decided by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. This human element introduces significant bias; for example, analyst JFresh<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)</a> noted a recurring bias against elite players on high-performing teams, where individual value is often overshadowed by the quality of a player’s supporting cast in his blog post 'The Hart Trophy is for the Best Player in the League \"umm actually\" shut up!'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the financial stakes are massive: insider Elliotte Friedman noted on the 32 Thoughts podcast<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)</a> that a franchise star like Connor McDavid (who is a 3 time Hart trophy winner) can generate up to an additional $50 million in team revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to objectify this evaluation process using data-driven modeling to define what truly constitutes \"the best\" at each position. We are building upon—and refining—methodologies seen in prior sports analytics work. For instance, a project exploring the various relationships between players’ birthdays, their experience vs. goal percentage, and age vs. penalty minutes used a variety of charts to identify and display different categorical and numerical data, such as box and scatter plots <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)</a>. They clearly organize their data in an easily accessible and understandable way—a method we can adopt to make our report more clear and simple to look at. For one of their hypotheses, the conclusion they drew for the relationship between goal percentage and shooting rates was that there wasn’t a strong linear correlation since the coefficient was 0.2. We can apply these learnings to our own project by accounting for the fact that there may be other factors that influence the value of a player, including being surrounded by a good team, as mentioned before by JFresh. \n",

    "A player’s plus-minus will have the greatest weight in determining the award outcome. This is because it is the most indicative measure of individual importance for team success in a game. A player can score a lot of goals, but if they are negative, it likely means that they are contributing to losses more than wins because they are contributing to more points lost than gained."

    "1. The ideal dataset would have complete data on all the players in the league in the different statistical categories (goals, assists, plus/minus) we are interested in, and would be sourced from the NHL itself, since their stats are not biased. Our data will span from the 2005-2006 season through the 2024-2025 season. This timeframe was chosen because it has been classified as the modern era. Furthermore, the 2005-2006 season marks the start of when NHL analytics started being tracked super heavily. The post-lockout era has widely been seen as its own era in the NHL defined by new rules such as two line passes, obstruction rules, trapezoid rule, shootout rules, and the league instituting a hard cap. We want to have clear player tracking to be able to match player stats per season to awards won. We anticipate approximately 900 players per season which gives around 18000 observations pre-cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "To predict award winners, our dataset will have these columns that we would like to have for the players are: player_name, player_id, season_year, team, position, goals, assists, points, +/-, penalty minutes, TOI, games played, team_record, and pdo. If the person is a goalie then we would like to have saves above expected, corsi for % (CF%), fenwick for % (FF%), and expected goals. We would also have to include variables relating to the team such as team_points and playoff_status. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning involves dropping all information that won’t be relevant to our project. We would drop players with not enough ice time and players who were injured for long amounts of time. Additionally, we would have to associate the different awards each player won in the season with their player ID. Furthermore, we can drop all players who did not receive a single vote for any award or if this player is below the average in certain statistics such as goals, saves, TOI. We will first create a league average measure of the different statistical categories before dropping the players below each metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will construct this relational datasets by merging datasets from MoneyPuck.com and the NHL game dataset from Kaggle. We will also look at award voting results from the official NHL records using player_name and season to cross-reference the datasets. The data is in csv format.\n",
